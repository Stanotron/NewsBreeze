NewsBreeze is a real-time updating news application. This app uses [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to get various sources and each source can provide major headlines.
It uses [Volley]([http://square.github.io/retrofit/](https://google.github.io/volley/)) to fetch news sources and news headlines from the API and displays in a RecyclerView.
App checks for fresh data from API and API is called to get the latest headlines.
